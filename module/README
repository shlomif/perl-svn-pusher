This is the README file for SVN::Push, a subversion repository 
distribution tool.

Subversion is a version control system, you can find more information
at http://subversion.tigris.org/.

svn-pusher is a command line utility that allows one to propagate ("push")
changesets between two repositories. SVN::Pusher is the back-end, and 
SVN::Pusher::CmdLine is its derived class, that also reports messages
to the command line.
